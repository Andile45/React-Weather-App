# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Application (React + TypeScript + CSS)

## üìå Overview
This is a **React TypeScript Weather Application** built as part of Lesson 4  
The app allows users to check real-time weather conditions for their **current location** as well as **searched locations**. Locations are persisted so users don‚Äôt have to re-search them.  

The application consumes data from a **third-party Weather API** and provides features like daily/hourly forecasts, multiple location support, dark mode, unit customization (Celsius/Fahrenheit), and offline caching.
